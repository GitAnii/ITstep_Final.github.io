<h1> How to make Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
<p>The first step in making these easy chocolate chip cookies to to combine the dry ingredients in a <br> medium size bowl.

    When doing this, make sure to Measure the flour correctly. Be sure to use a measuring cup made <br> for dry ingredients (NOT a pyrex liquid measuring cup). Then, measure flour by scooping it into a <br> measuring cup and leveling it with a knife.</p>

  <p>Next, cream together butter and sugars, make sure to soften the butter early by taking it out of the <br> fridge at least two hours before baking so it is ready to go when you need it. You can also warm it in <br> the microwave for about 7 seconds, but be very careful not to melt it.
<br>
    Once butter/sugar mixture is beaten well, add the eggs & vanilla and beat to combine.</p>

   <p>Add dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Then add the chocolate chips and beat until they <br> are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

 <strong> Use LOTS of chocolate chips. </strong>  You want at least two gooey chocolate chips <br> in every bite.</p>

<p>The chocolate chip cookie dough should be easy to roll and not sticky. It should not be dry or <br> crumbly. See photo below for the optimal texture.</p>

<h1>Portion & roll dough</h1>
<p>Once the cookie dough is finished, it is time to portion and roll the dough. I know many people <br> eyeball it when making cookies, however I highly recommend using a cookie scoop.</p>
<p>Using a cooking scoop ensures that all the cookies are uniform in size so that they bake evenly. <br> I love this stainless steel cookie scoop and use it every time I make cookies.
 <br>
    At this point you can either bake your dough or freeze it.</p>

    <h1>To freeze cookie dough:</h1>
    <p>Since this chocolate chip cookie recipe makes so many cookies, I always make a full batch and freeze some. <br> That way I have dough on hand for unexpected guests or whenever the cookie craving strikes.
      <br>
        I prefer to flash-freeze the cookie dough before putting it in an airtight container. To do this, roll <br> the cookie dough into balls and space them out on a parchment lined baking sheet. Then put the <br> baking sheet in the freezer for about 30 minutes, or until the dough slightly freezes.
         <br>
        Once the dough is slightly frozen, transfer the cookie dough balls to an airtight container or plastic <br> bag and freeze for up to 2 months.</p>
        <h1>How to bake frozen dough</h1>
        <p>There are two ways to bake frozen dough:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Thaw it first:</strong>  I love having dough ready to go in the freezer for impromptu guests. When you <br> want to bake them, remove the dough balls from the freezer, set them on a parchment-lined <br> baking sheet and cover with a light cloth towel or napkin to let them thaw. Then, once they <br> reach room temperature (after about 1-2 hours depending on the temperature of your kitchen) <br> bake as directed in the recipe (at 375 degrees F). SO easy!</li>
             <li><strong>Bake from frozen:</strong>  Place the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet. Then, preheat the oven <br> to 350 degrees Fahrenheit <strong> (ONLY if you are baking the frozen dough)</strong> and put the cookies in <br> the oven in the beginning of the preheating time. (So put the cookies in the oven as you <br> preheat it). Set the timer for 15 minutes and remove the cookies after 15 minutes. The top will <br> look a little more brown than usual, but they will still taste amazing.</li>
        </ol>
      <br>  <img src="images/donati6.png" alt="" class="image"> 
        <h1>Bake until they just barely look done</h1>
        <p>If you are baking the cookies immediately simply roll them into balls, place them evenly apart on a <br> baking sheet (about 1.5 to 2 inches apart) and bake at 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes.
           <br>
            The most important piece of advice I can give you is - DO NOT over-bake these chocolate chip cookies! <br> They will not look done when you pull them out of the oven, and that is GOOD.
            <br>
            At the end of the baking time, these chocolate chip cookies will not look done but they are. They will <br> look a little doughy when you remove them from the oven, and thats good. They may be lightly <br> browned in a few places, which is exactly how you want them.
            
           <br> They will set up as they sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes. I never bake them for more than <br> 9 minutes</p>
